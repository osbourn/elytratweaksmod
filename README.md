# Elytra Tweaks Mod

Have you ever felt that the Elytra in Minecraft was too powerful and rendered other
transportation systems useless? Several mods resolve this issue by nerfing Elytra
mechanics by making it slower or more expensive to travel long distances (for example,
by removing fireworks). The problem with this solution is that it makes the Elytra
less fun to use because it is now much less capable.

This mod decides to nerf the Elytra in a different way: by making it very *dangerous*.
It is now much easier to die when flying if you aren't paying much attention or make
mistakes. This provides a strong reason to avoid relying on Elytra as your primary
means of transportation, but makes it a very capable tool for those who are able to
master it.

In vanilla Minecraft, you typically won't die when using an Elytra if you even a
bit careful because flying into a wall doesn't do enough damage to kill you in most
circumstances. This mod multiplies that damage by a configurable amount to make flying
close to blocks a much more risky endeavor.

Elytra Tweaks also provides a new landing mechanic which requires special attention to
avoid taking lots of damage and losing armor durability.
